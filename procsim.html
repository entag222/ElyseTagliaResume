								<p>In this work, we present a method for calculating hydration and formation energies of molecules using the GFN2-xTB method. The code takes a SMILES representation of a molecule, generates its conformers, calculates their energies in both gas and aqueous phases, and computes the hydration and formation energies. Furthermore, the code calculates the RDKFingerprint of the molecule, which can be used for similarity searches. The method was tested on ethane, acetone, caffeine, and tryptophan. Formation and hydration energies predictions for ethane and acetone were highly accurate with a 0.0046% error for ethane and 1.0% error for acetone. The method consistently predicts accurate formation energies for large polar molecules as well, with 0.93% and 0.65% error for caffeine and tryptophan, respectively. Predicted hydration energies for caffeine and tryptophan had large errors of 47% and 29% error, respectively. The results show the robustness of the method in predicting formation energies and its limitations in predicting hydration energies for large polar and organic molecules.  </p>
