									<h1>Energy Sustainability Internship with the Rockefeller Center </h1>
									</header>
								<p>Tishman Speyer has adopted a net-zero by 2050 goal for all of the buildings in its Portfolio. With over 10,000,000 sqft of buildings in NYC alone, there is a large need to develop plans for renovations and capital projects that increase efficiency, eliminate CO2 emissions, and place our buildings on a path to net zero.

Our interns will help work on a variety of tasks. At Rockefeller Center, there is a need to design energy recovery heat pumps for domestic hot water, ventilation, and hot water systems on campus. Existing meter data needs to be validated and new meters need to be installed if not existing. These load profiles will determine equipment sizing, along with engineering calculations on loads where meters don't exist. Help with procurement of heat pumps through extensive market research is needed, and energy models created for financial analysis.

Efficiency work also needs to be done on existing, steam, chilled water, and domestic hot water systems, with a focus on accurate metering to determine building level profiles, proper energy use breakdowns, and review of utility billing for base building and submeter systems. Aid is needed in updating mechanical drawings through on-site surveys and organizing other energy system documentation.

Finally, financial models are needed to compare business as usual to properly timed capital projects and renovations, to assure net-zero goals are met with the greatest financial efficiency. Data from past and current feasibility studies must be integrated into existing business plans, incorporated with existing repairs & maintenance expenses, and future capital projects. Comparisons of energy/carbon reduction measures can be made with regards to methods and timing.
