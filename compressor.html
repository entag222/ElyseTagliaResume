								<p>This study focuses on the design and optimization of a compressor stage for a new type of gas turbofan engine, aiming to minimize the power required for operation, while satisfying the given performance requirements. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach using ANSYS Fluent is employed to determine the optimal geometry of the compressor rotors and rotor speed. The compressor stage is designed to provide a minimum pressure ratio of 20:1 at maximum design altitude (37,000 ft) and to work efficiently at sea level under standard temperature and pressure (STP) conditions. The outer diameter of the compressor, including all necessary parts, is constrained at 6 ft, and the maximum operating speed of any stage should be less than 50,000 rpm..</p>
